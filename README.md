 My audience will be inndividuals that are interested in relocating to mars.

I want to create a Web Application that displays homes to buy and some restaurants and shoppng locations on mars.

Elevator:Hi, my name is Tyrone Usher and I have always loved interacting with computers.  While surfing online,
Savvy caught my attention, not only by its distinctive name but their teaching approach. I decided to become a 
student at Savvy and learn to code through the boot camp.  For my capstone project I decided to make a website 
that will bring comfort to the newly relocated humans on Mars!
